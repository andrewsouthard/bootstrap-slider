# bootstrap-slider
Multi-item bootstrap slider based on the bootstrap carousel written using jQuery. Take the bootstrap carousel example code from the [bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#carousel) and add the 
slider CSS class and include slider.css and slider.js. The slider.js module will find all sliders on the page and initialize them for you. When including the script, you can add the following options to the script tag to override the defaults:

* **data-indicatorLinks**: true or false. This defines whether to make the indicators links that change the slider to the item associated with that indicator.
